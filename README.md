# SDL#

The SDL# library is a [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) wrapper around the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) (SDL) library, a cross-platform graphics, audio, and input library. It provides both a set of low-level APIs that enables calling most SDL APIs directly, and a set of high-level object-oriented classes that abstracts working with the SDL API in a more .NET-friendly way.

You can include SDL# in your project using the [SDLSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SdlSharp) NuGet package.
